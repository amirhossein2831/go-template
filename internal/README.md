The **/internal** directory is for all the private code that makes your application work. The Go compiler enforces a rule: no other project can ever import code from your /internal directory. This allows you to change this code freely without worrying about breaking someone else's application.

### optional structure your code inside /internal as your project gets bigger:

**/internal/app/{myapp}** : You would put code here that is only used by one specific application. For example, logic that is unique to your first-app and would never be used by second-app.

**/internal/pkg/{myprivlib}** : You would put code here if you want to share it between your own applications (like between first-app and second-app in your monorepo), but you still want to keep it private from the outside world. Think of it as your project's "private shared library."

In short, it's a way to organize a large project so you can distinguish between "code for this one app" and "code shared between my apps." For small project size, you don't necessarily need this extra level of structure yet, but it's a good pattern to be aware of as your application grows.
